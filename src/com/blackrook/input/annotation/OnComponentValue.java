/**
 * An annotation that is attached to a method to call when a controller's field changes.
 * <p>Unlike {@link OnChange}, this calls the method for EVERY float-typed annotated component that changes.
 * <p>The method that this is attached to is called DURING the poll, as fields are set.
 * <p>The method must be public and must have two parameters: an InputComponent and a float field.
